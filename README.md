Logistic regression applied to MNIST dataset

After completed the first course of Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
taught by Andrew Ng, I am implementing the algorithms on my own to retain the
material taught. In this first notebook, the logistic regression algorithm is 
applied in the MNIST dataset.
